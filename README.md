# Coherent Coding Assessment
Coherent Backend Developer Coding Assessment
Backend Engineer (.Net)

Instruction
===========
This is the problem statement for BE engineers (.Net):

You’re building a backend service to support the good reads mobile app. Please build a set of APIs that would allow a user to do the following activities:
1. Add a book to the list of books they have read
2. View a list of books they have completed reading
3. Search for a book by name

We’re looking only for APIs, no Frontend is needed.
Please make sure that the APIs are RESTful.
We are looking for clean, readable code with unit tests.

For both FE and BE engineers, the evaluation criteria is:
• Is the code readable?
• Can it be extended easily?
• Is it covered decently well by unit tests?
• Are there any big logic issues?
• Any good uses of design patterns?

We are looking for clean, readable and well tested code that can be evolved easily. Since the
questions are subjective, detailed answers for the questions will be good, we are not looking for
any scores or numbers.
